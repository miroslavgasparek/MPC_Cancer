% The function calculates the optimal input for the dynamical system
% in a condensed form using the MATLAB built-in mpc quadratic programming
% solver

function [u,status,iA1] = genMPController(H,G,F,bb,J,L,x,xTarget,m,iA)
% H       - quadratic term in the cost function (Linv if using mpcqpsolver).
% G       - matrix in the linear term in the cost function.
% F       - LHS of the inequalities term.
% bb      - RHS of the inequalities term.
% J       - RHS of inequalities term.
% L       - RHS of inequalities term. Use this to shift constraints around target point
% x       - current state
% xTarget - target equilibrium point.
% m       - Number of inputs.
% iA      - active inequalities, see doc mpcqpsolver
%
% u is the first input vector u_0 in the sequence [u_0; u_1; ...; u_{N-1}]; 
% In other words, u is the value of the receding horizon control law
% evaluated with the current state x0 and target xTarget

% Please read the documentation on mpcqpsolver to understand how it is
% supposed to be used. Use iA and iA1 to pass the active inequality vector
